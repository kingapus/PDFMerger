# PDFMerger
This a customized script for merging different pages of 2 different PDF documents. This was created for a research project that wanted a quick way to merge selected pages of 2 different documents. Originally, there is a template document with 7 pages numbered 1 to 7. All other documents are 3-paged and are numbered; 1, 5 and 6. This script takes the 3-paged document and replaces the respective pages in the 7-paged template.

## Note: This is a customized script. It doesn't work for merging all PDFs. Page numbers and directories are hard-coded into the script.
